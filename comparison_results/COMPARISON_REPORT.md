# Priority Scheduling vs FCFS Scheduling - Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

This report compares two scheduling approaches for EV charging:
1. **Priority Scheduling (pipeline.py)**: Uses a multi-objective priority scoring system (urgency, degradation, grid stress, price factors)
2. **FCFS Scheduling (pipeline_fcfs.py)**: First-Come-First-Served admission based on arrival time

## Key Findings

### Baseline Comparison (30 Chargers)

| Metric | Priority | FCFS | Difference | % Change |
|--------|----------|------|------------|----------|
| **Average Net Energy Cost per EV** | 3.61 | 5.53 | +1.92 | +53.05% |
| **Average Battery Degradation Cost** | 0.29 | 0.44 | +0.15 | +53.05% |
| **Grid Load Variance** | 8,292.74 | 48,483.62 | +40,191 | +484.65% |
| **Average User Satisfaction** | 0.73 | 0.998 | +0.27 | +36.67% |
| **Average Waiting Time (hours)** | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00% |
| **Fairness (Gini Coefficient)** | 0.278 | 0.218 | -0.06 | -21.55% |
| **Objective J (normalized)** | -0.138 | -0.187 | -0.049 | +35.79% |

### Insights

1. **Priority Scheduling Advantages**:
   - Lower energy costs (53% lower per EV)
   - Lower grid load variance (much more stable grid operation)
   - Better fairness (more equitable distribution)
   - Lower battery degradation costs
   - Better overall objective value (J)

2. **FCFS Advantages**:
   - Higher user satisfaction (+36.67%)
   - Simpler implementation

### Trade-off Analysis

- **Priority Scheduling** prioritizes system efficiency (cost, grid stability, fairness) but slightly sacrifices user satisfaction
- **FCFS Scheduling** prioritizes user satisfaction but at the cost of increased energy costs and grid instability

## Fleet Size Effect Analysis

See the following plots in this directory:
- `fleet_effect_avg_user_satisfaction.png`: How user satisfaction varies with fleet size
- `fleet_effect_avg_waiting_time.png`: How waiting time varies with fleet size
- `fleet_effect_fairness_gini.png`: How fairness varies with fleet size
- `fleet_effect_avg_net_energy_cost.png`: How energy cost varies with fleet size

## Recommendations

1. **For Grid Stability**: Use Priority Scheduling to minimize grid load variance
2. **For Cost Optimization**: Use Priority Scheduling to reduce energy and degradation costs
3. **For Fairness**: Use Priority Scheduling for more equitable energy distribution
4. **For User Satisfaction**: Use FCFS if user satisfaction is the primary concern

## Notes

- Both approaches have zero waiting time in the tested scenarios
- Priority Scheduling uses a sophisticated multi-objective scoring system
- FCFS is simpler and easier to implement
- The difference becomes more pronounced as fleet size varies
